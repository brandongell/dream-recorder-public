# Email Options with Cloudflare

## Option 1: Cloudflare Email Workers (Requires Workers plan)
- Can send emails directly through Cloudflare
- Requires setting up a Worker script
- More complex setup

## Option 2: Use a Simple Email Service
These services offer generous free tiers and are much easier than Gmail:

### Resend (Recommended - Super Simple)
- Free tier: 3,000 emails/month
- No complex authentication
- Just an API key

### SendGrid
- Free tier: 100 emails/day forever
- Simple API
- Reliable delivery

### Mailgun
- Free tier: 5,000 emails/month for 3 months
- Then 1,000 emails/month free
- Easy setup

## Option 3: Use Your Domain's Email (Simplest)
If you have email set up for [YOUR-DOMAIN] through any provider (Google Workspace, Zoho, etc.), we can use those SMTP settings.

Which option would you prefer? I recommend Resend for simplicity.
